Continuous-time stochastic processes often carry the condition of having
almost-surely continuous paths. If some process $X$ satisfies certain bounds on
its expectation, then the Kolmogorov-Chentsov theorem lets us construct
a modification of $X$, i.e. a process $X'$ such that $\forall t. X_t = X'_t$
almost surely, that has Hölder continuous paths.

In this work, we mechanise the Kolmogorov-Chentsov theorem. To get there,
we develop a theory of stochastic processes, together with Hölder
continuity, convergence in measure, and arbitrary intervals of dyadic
rationals.

With this, we pave the way towards a construction of Brownian motion. The work
is based on the exposition in [Achim Klenke's probability theory
